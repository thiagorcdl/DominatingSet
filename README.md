This is still a work-in-progress that uses a costly backtracking algorithm
to solve the Dominating Set problem on a connected graph.

FILES:
	README		- This file.
	Makefile	- "make" to compile. "clean" to erase generated files.
	src/
		bt.cpp	- Backtracking algorithm implementation.
		check.cpp - Code for checking if a given set is dominating.
	fullerenes/*	- Fullerene graph inputs provided by professor
			  Dr. Wendy Myrvold of the University of Victoria.
	test.sh		- Script for automating the fullerene tests.
